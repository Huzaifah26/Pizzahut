This is my first project in SQL and Power Bi.
In pizza sales project, I analyzed a dataset using SQL to uncover valuable business insights, including total sales revenue, top-selling pizzas, sales trends by day and time, and customer preferences. 
Using MySQL Workbench, I wrote queries to calculate these metrics, helping to identify peak sales periods, popular pizza varieties, and frequent customer behaviors. 
After extracting the data insights, I used Power BI to create visualizations that made the data accessible and interactive, with dashboards displaying total sales, popular items, and peak order times.
This project demonstrated  SQL proficiency for data analysis and Power BI skills for creating compelling visual summaries, offering a comprehensive view of sales performance for decision-making.
